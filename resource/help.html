<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Basics</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Type the notes you would like to play. You can type them in any case (Upper, lower, or mixed case), and they are spelled as follows: sa re ga ma pa dha ni.</li>
<li>To play a note in the higher octave, type a period after the note name. For example, the last note in the sargam is high sa, which would be written as "Sa." without the quotation marks.</li>
<li>To play a note a half step higher (theevra), type an apostrophe after the note name. For example, theevra ma would be written as "ma'" without the quotation marks. To play a note a half step lower, put the apostrophe before the note. So komal re would be written as "'re". NOTE: Although some notes don't have theevra or komal notes associated with them, using the apostrophe syntax will still lower or raise the note a half step, so be careful. (This will be fixed in a future release).</li>
<li>To hold a note down, type a dash in place of the next note. For example, if you wanted to hold down the note sa for two beats, instead of typing "sa sa" you would type "sa -"</li>
<li>After creating a shabad, you can save this shabad in a shabad file by going to File -&gt; Save. You can open files by going to File -&gt; Open. When you're finished with your current file, you can click on File -&gt; Create New File to make a new file. Note that if you have modified the file or have not saved your file, you will be prompted to save the file before continuing. However, if you exit the application you WILL NOT be prompted to save, even if your file is modified. This will be changed in the next version.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Controls</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>You can change the tempo between 0.1 and 2 by click up and down in the Tempo Box, or you can type in the number yourself.</li>
<li>Click play to play the shabad. You can click pause to pause the playback and then play again to resume. You can press Stop when the shabad is playing or paused to stop playback. You can not edit the tempo or the shabad while the shabad is playing.</li>
<li>You can specify start and stop labels in their respective input boxes, so that pressing play will only play the notes between those two labels. If you specify a start/end label, it must be present in the shabad. Put a '#' before all labels in the shabad. If no start label is specified, the shabad will start at the beginning, and if no end label is specified, the shabad will end at the end.</li>
