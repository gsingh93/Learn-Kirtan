	<h2>Keyboard Modes</h2>
	There are two main keyboard modes, both of which can be accessed through the Keyboard Modes menu. The default mode is Edit Mode.
	In this mode, you can type normally in the editor. The other mode is Compose Mode. In Compose Mode, the keys have the same mapping as
	when playing the notes with the keyboard (playing the notes with the keyboard was described in the
	<a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a> section). When a note is pressed, that note both played and written in the editor.
	Thus, you can type a shabad by playing it on the keyboard.
