	<h2>Playing Two Notes in One Beat</h2>
	Sometimes a shabad has fast notes where two notes are played
	in one beat. To do this, type a dash between the two notes
	with no spaces. This will "link" the two notes so that
	they are both played in the same beat.
	<br>
	<br>
	For example, typing "sa-re" would play Sa and Re in the same
	beat.
