	<h2>Holding Down Notes for Multiple Beats</h2>
	Sometimes a shabad requires that you hold down a note for
	multiple beats with pressing the note multiple times. To
	achieve this in <em>Learn Kirtan</em>, type a dash after
	the note to hold it down for another beat.
	<br>
	<br>
	For example, typing "sa" would play Sa once. Typing "sa sa"
	would play sa twice, but would press the key twice. Typing
	"sa -" would press the Sa key once but hold it down for
	two beats.
