	<h2>Opening and Saving Files</h2>
	To open an existing file, go to <b>File -> Open</b>. This will
	bring you to a window which will allow you to choose a shabad
	file. Shabad files have a .sbd extension, and thus you will
	only be able to select files that have this extension.
	<br>
	<br>
	To save a file, go to <b>File -> Save</b>. If your file has
	been edited, you will be prompted to save. You can tell if
	your file has been modified by checking whether there is a
	asterisk (*) in the title of the window. If there is, the file
	has been modified since the last save. If you select "Yes" on
	the save prompt, a window will open and allow you to choose
	where to save the file. If you add the .sbd extension, the file
	will be saved as is. If the extension is left out, it will be
	added automatically by the application.
