	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Welcome to <em>Learn Kirtan</em>! This software was developed by Gulshan Singh to help people of all ages and skill levels learn kirtan.</p>
	<p>This application allows teachers to type shabads in the editor, save them, and distribute them to students, who can then
	open the shabad file on their computers and watch the notes play on their screen.</p>
	<p>If this is your first time using <em>Learn Kirtan</em>, you should read the <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.
	You can learn about the complete feature set by looking through the <a href="features.html">Features</a> section.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to email me at
	<b>gulshan@umich.edu</b>.</p>
	<p>If you would like to contribute to the <em>Learn Kirtan</em> project, please email me. This project is
