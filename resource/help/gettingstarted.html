	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	To get started, we'll type a simple sargam. Type the following
	in the editor:
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		sa re ga ma pa dha ni sa.
	</div>
	<br>
	The period after the last sa means to play the upper Sa instead
	of the regular Sa. Note that whatever you type in the editor
	is not case sensitive. So typing Sa, SA, or even sA in the
	editor would play the note "Sa".
	<br>
	<br>
	Now click the play button. You should see and hear the sargam being
	played on the keyboard. You can pause the playback at any time
	and then hit play to resume. Pressing stop stops the playback
	entirely. Note that while the playback is playing and while it
	is pause, you cannot edit the shabad.
	<br>
	<br>
	You can also play along with the playback or play on your own.
	To start playing with the keyboard click on any note on the
	keyboard and then press the key 'A'. One of the white keys
	should have been played. The rest of the keys
	on the keyboard follow from this; it's meant to be played like
	a harmonium. To play notes in the lower octave press 'Z', to
	play notes in the upper octave press 'X'. To read more about
	octaves, see <a href="octaves.html">here</a>.

	That's all you need to get started! Read the rest of the help
	contents to learn about more advanced features.
