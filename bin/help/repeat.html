	<h2>Repeating Lines</h2>
	If you're practicing a shabad or a specific line of a shabad
	(using labels), you may want the line to repeat once the
	shabad or line has finished. To do this, check the repeat
	checkbox in the control panel. When checked, playback will
	only stop when the pause or stop button is clicked.
