	<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
	<em>Learn Kirtan</em> includes a number of keyboard shortcuts
	for quick access to settings and other features. There
	are two types of shortcuts, menu mnemonics and accelerators.
	<br>
	<br>
	Mnemonics are keys to press to navigate through the menu
	quickly. For example, you can see that the "F" in "File" is
	underlined in the menu. This mean that "F" is a mnemonic for
	"File". Pressing <b>Alt+F</b> opens the file menu. Once in 
	the file menu, you can see that "O" is underlined in the
	word "Open". This means that "O" is a mnemonic for "Open".
	Pressing <b>O</b> (without the Alt) is equivalent to clicking
	"Open". Note that the Alt key is only used to open the initial
	menu, but is not needed after this.
	<br>
	<br>
	The other type of shortcut is an accelerator. An accelerator
	is a key combination that executes a command. A complete
	list of accelerators is given below. Note that the accelerator
	is often given next to the name of the corresponding menu option.
