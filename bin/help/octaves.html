	<h2>Octaves</h2>
	An octave is the set of notes in the sargam. Because there are
	three sets of notes on the <em>Learn Kirtan</em> keyboard,
	there must be a way to access all three octaves. By default,
	a note refers to the middle octave. To play a note in the lower
	octave, type a period (.) before the note. To play a note in
	the upper octave, type a period (.) after the note. If you
	try to play a note that is not on the keyboard, you will see
	an error message and playback will stop.

	For example, Sa in the upper octave would be written as "sa.",
	without the quotes. Lower Ni would be written as ".Ni", without
	the quotes. Note that when you have a note that is both komal
	and in the lower octave or a note that is both theevra and in
	the upper octave, the order of the period and apostrophe can
	be switched with a problem.
