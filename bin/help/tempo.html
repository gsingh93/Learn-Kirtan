	<h2>Changing the Tempo</h2>
	Not all shabads have the same tempo, and sometimes you may
	want to slow a shabad down so it's easier to practice. You can
	change the tempo by editing the value in the tempo box. The
	value in the tempo box can range from 0.1 to 2.0, which means
	the shabad will play at 0.1 times the speed or 2 times the 
	speed, respectively.
