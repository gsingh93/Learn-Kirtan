	<h2>Starting and Ending Labels</h2>
	Labels are a useful feature that allow you to select certain
	regions of the shabad to play. Let's say your shabad looked like
	<br><br>
	<span style="text-align:center">sa re ga ma pa dha ni sa.</span>
	Let's say you only want to practice the first four notes. To do
	this, simply put a label after the fourth note like so,
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center">
		sa re ga ma #a pa dha ni sa.
	</div>
	<br>
	Now if you put the letter "a" in the "End Label" box in the control
	panel and press play, playback will stop when this label is
	reached. Let's now say you want to practice the last four notes
	Remove "a" from the "End Label" box and put "a" in the "Start Label"
	box. Now when you click play, playback starts from the label
	"#a" and ends at the end of the shabad. You can specify both
	starting and ending labels or simply specify one.
	<br>
	<br>
	Note that if you specify a starting label, it must be present
	in the shabad or you will receive an error. Also note
	that labels appear in the shabad as "#label", but only "label" is
	put in the boxes. Finally, if you specify a starting label,
	make sure it is not followed by a dash (as the program will
	not know which note to hold)
